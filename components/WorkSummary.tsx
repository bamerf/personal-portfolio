    <p>
      My work has always been around the JavaScript and TypeScript ecosystem.
    </p>
    <p>
      I&apos;ve designed and architected complete platforms, built numerous
      projects with modern frameworks and different styling methodologies, and
      built a number of design systems and UI libraries.
    </p>
    <p>
      I enjoy looking at projects from a top down perspective, so I often
      involve myself with all aspect of the development process, from product
      vision and platform architecture, all the way down to code optimisation
      and design patterns.
    </p>

    <p>
      Recently I&apos;ve been focusing more on frontend technologies. Having
      built a number of UI libraries and many interfaces, I&apos;ve come to
      appreciate the nuanced balance between the technical and the aesthetic.
    </p>
    <p>
      My moto is Methodical Artistry and my goal is to fine tune my work to be
      accessible and user-friendly, functional and fluid, and simple and
      elegant.
