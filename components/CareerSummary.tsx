    <p>
      Before moving into the software engineering space I was in the film
      industry.
    </p>
    <p>
      I was always more comfortable with the technical aspects of my work so
      after a few years I found myself managing post-production teams and
      teaching about modern patters and technologies used in the industry.
    </p>
    <p>
      When I moved into software engineering I was lucky to be exposed to
      emerging languages like TypeScript, emerging frameworks like NextJS and
      exciting patterns like JamStack.
    </p>
    <p>
      I&apos;m now focusing more on frontend architecture, user interfaces and
      design system where I can infuse my love for technical organisation and
      satisfying aesthetics.
